NEW PROJECT — Website (standar) with QRIS payment page

Files included:
- index.html      -> Home page with package list and Order buttons
- payment.html    -> Payment page showing QRIS (placeholder) + confirmation form
- qris.svg        -> Placeholder QR image (replace with your real QR file)
- README.md       -> This file

How to use:
1. Replace 'qris.svg' with your real QR image file (keep the same filename), or edit payment.html to point to your QR image URL.
2. Upload all files to your GitHub repo (index.html at the root).
3. Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → deploy from main branch root). Site will be available at https://username.github.io/repo-name/

Notes:
- Confirmation opens WhatsApp to +62 856-5050-103 with a pre-filled message.
- The site is static (no server needed). QRIS verification is manual: admin must check payments.
